# FakeSquare API

This is documentation for the theoretical checkin app API that has been built
throughout the book [Build APIs You Won't Hate].

[Build APIs You Won't Hate]: https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate

## Authorization

This could be anything, but it seems like a good place to explain how
access tokens work.

Most endpoints in the FakeSquare API will require the `Authorization` HTTP header.

```http
Authorization: bearer 5262d64b892e8d4341000001
```

Failing to do so will cause the following error:

```json
{
  "error" : {
    "code" : "GEN-MAYBGTFO",
    "http_code" : 401,
    "message" : "Unauthorized"
  }
}
```

Or something. This is mostly just an introduction, so provide links to tutorial
sections elsewhere on your site.
